Compose Multiplatform Navigation && ViewModel, inspired by Jetpack Lifecycle, ViewModel, LiveData and Navigation, PreCompose provides similar (or even the same) components for you but in Kotlin, and it's Kotlin Multiplatform project.

# Why PreCompose
 - Write your business logic and UI code once in one `commonMain`, and your application can be anywhere, powered by Kotlin and Compose!
 - If you familiar with Jetpack Lifecycle, ViewModel and Navigation, there will be nothing to learn.
 - Super easy to set up.
 - No need to write platform-specific code and UI.
 - Lifecycle is handled by PreCompose, you don't need to worry about it.
 - With Molecule integration, you can easily write your business logic in Kotlin Multiplatform project.
